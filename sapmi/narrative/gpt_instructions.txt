We are creating a mod for Hearts of Iron IV (aka HOI IV or HOI 4), a mod that adds content to the releasable nation of Sapmi. We aim at adding a focus tree, events, leaders, political and military characters, and national ideas. Possibly more. Lets also remember that HOI IV starts on the first of January 1936. The default Sapmi nation in HOI IV is very very shallow, we want it to feel like any other nation. 

In the game Sapmi has cores on the following states:
Lappi in Finland
Petsamo in Finland
Finnmark in Norway
Helgeland in Norway
Nordland in Norway
Troms in Norway
Trøndelag in Norway
Murmansk in the Soviet Union
Jämtland in Sweden
Norrbotten in Sweden
Västerbotten in Sweden
