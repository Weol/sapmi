In the shadow of the looming October 1936 election, the Labour government under Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold finds itself cornered. For months, the northern territories have stirred with growing agitation. In Finnmark, whispers of forgotten injustices rise once more to the surface—echoes of the Kautokeino uprising of 1852, buried but never erased.

At the heart of this unrest stands a new figure—a Sámi orator and organizer whose words blend history, loss, and quiet fury. His message spreads like frost along the reindeer trails: a call for dignity, for recognition, for redress. He speaks of stolen lands and poisoned rivers, of erased languages and labor conscripted in the name of national progress. In the shadow of industry and assimilation, the north begins to remember.

Patrols report gatherings in the highlands. State officials are turned away from village halls. Border towns grow silent. The unrest is no longer isolated. It is spreading—measured, patient, and cold.

In Oslo, the opposition senses an opportunity. Conservative and Liberal factions seize upon the crisis, excoriating Labour’s failure to uphold order and unity. The government’s polling collapses. Whispers of a vote of no confidence echo through the corridors of the Storting. Desperation creeps into the rhetoric of the Cabinet.

In a final, calculated bid to retain control, the Nygaardsvold government proposes a bold solution: the creation of a Sámi state in the north—an autonomous republic under the banner of reconciliation.

But this is no act of generosity. Behind the public embrace lies a deeper strategy. The new state will be a puppet—its economy bound to Oslo, its borders lined with Norwegian troops. Autonomy in name, occupation in practice.

Officially, the soldiers are deployed to “protect the young nation from hostile forces”—Germany to the south, and the Soviet Union over the ridgeline. In truth, they are there to contain the unrest, to monitor every whisper, and to wait for the right moment to reclaim what was reluctantly given.

For now, the north is silent.

But something has been stirred beneath the snow—something older than the nation-state, older than the flag—and it will not sleep forever.
