In the shadow of the looming October 1936 election, the Labour government under Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold finds itself cornered. For months, the northern territories have stirred with strange fervor. A religious revival—strikingly reminiscent of the Laestadian awakenings of the previous century—has taken hold of the Sámi population in Finnmark, igniting long-buried wounds from the brutal suppression of the Kautokeino uprising in 1852.

At the center of this growing storm is a charismatic preacher—a devout and enigmatic figure who channels both scripture and centuries of Sámi grievance. His sermons are whispered to carry a fire that burns hotter than faith: a call for spiritual liberation entwined with political reckoning. Across the tundra, settlements rally to his voice. Patrols vanish. The old gods are named again in the forests.

The unrest is no longer local. It is spreading like frostbite—silent and deep.

Within the halls of Oslo, the opposition senses blood. Conservative and Liberal factions seize upon the turmoil, lambasting Labour’s failure to maintain order. Polling collapses. Whispers of a vote of no confidence stir among backbenchers. Desperation creeps into the rhetoric of the government.

In a last, calculated gamble to preserve power, the Nygaardsvold Cabinet proposes a stunning solution: the formal creation of a Sámi nation—an autonomous republic carved from the wild north. But this is no gift of freedom. Behind the veil of benevolence lies a darker motive: the new state will be a puppet, its borders ringed with Norwegian soldiers, its economy bound by Oslo’s grip.

Officially, the troops are there to “safeguard the young nation's sovereignty” from foreign threats—Germany to the south, and the Soviet Union looming just over the ridgeline. In truth, they are there to crush the embers of rebellion before they become wildfire.

The north is to be placated, contained, and watched—until the time is right to reclaim what was given.

But something has been stirred in the Arctic dusk. Something older than borders, and not so easily put back to sleep.
